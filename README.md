This is a web development project.
Tech stack are:

  Backend - Python
  Database - Firebase
  Framework - Flask
  
Problem Statement:
  The project deals with the problem of resolving the complicatedness of multifactor authentication(MFA) of any application.Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security technology that requires multiple methods of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user's identity for a login or other transaction. If we lose the physical device which is linked to an application, we cannot log into it. So to overcome it we need backup codes which are given by the application. The project aims to store the username, password, and backup codes with a highly encrypted algorithm like AES/DES. All this information will be stored in a cloud database so that users can log in from anywhere.
